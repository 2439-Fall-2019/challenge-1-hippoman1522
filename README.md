I have 5 main screens Home, Reservations, Location, Menu, and Survey. The menu screen will have multiple other
screens based on the different menu items. I plan to include a working reservation ui in the reservation screen
and plan on having a working google map on the location screen. The home screen will just be a navigation center for
every other page and each page will have a button to go back to the home page.

Usability test: 1.) They took intereset in the theme colors, and the iframes. They took the nav links from top to bottom on the home page. They 
stopped to read the menu a bit, and also the reservation page. They skipped the location page.

2.) I asked them to find a specific menu item without telling them it was a menu item. They ended up finding the menu item effortlesly. 
They took some navigation before they realised it was a menu item and navigated through the internal pages to find it.
They really didnt get frustrated just because it was a small selection of options to choose from. 

3.) They suggested that i added a bit more color to my theme, and also add some more images.

4.) Overall they said that it was a good website and that there was obviously some room for improvement.
